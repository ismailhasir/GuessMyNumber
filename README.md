# GuessMyNumber
I made this mini game project for learn and project practice about DOM Manipulation. (Vanilla JavaScript.
)

- Game generqates a random number between 1-20.
- You should 'guees' the randomly generated number, as least tries as possible.
- Every 'wrong' guess costs you 1 point from your score.
- Game keeps your "High Score" as long as you keep playing the game.
